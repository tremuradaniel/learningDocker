# Accessing the application 

This assumes you are using Kubernetes on Docker Desktop. Don't use this chart for anything serious.

1. Run `kubectl get svc`
2. Find the PORT value after 8080: for hello-world-service. For instance, 30519 for 8080:30519/TCP.
3. Run `curl localhost:{your-port}`

# Updating

Modify the Message value (such as in values.yaml) and run `helm upgrade` to change the message. 

The current message is:

"{{ .Values.Message }}"
